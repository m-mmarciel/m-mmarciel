ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Maximillian Marciel.

Currently, this repository exists as a "Portfolio" of sorts of projects that I am doing or have undertaken previously.
Hopefully it demonstrates my competency and passion for the field. Many of these projects are specifically intended to be for fun,
or to demonstrate competency in small departments. Others, such as RoadVizVR, are larger projects done with coordinated teams.

If I could recommend you take a look at any projects in particular, it would be RoadVizVR, AVL-Tree-Implementation, or MyPL-Interpreter-Full.

If you want to reach me, you can find me on maxmarciel2@gmail.com. Thanks for looking!
